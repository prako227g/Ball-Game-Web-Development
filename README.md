# Ball-Game-Web-Development
This project is a simple game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game involves navigating a small red character (represented by a red circle) at the bottom of the screen using the left and right arrow keys. The objective is to avoid black blocks and navigate through white holes that appear randomly at the top of the screen

Features:
Character Movement: Use the left and right arrow keys to move the character horizontally.
Obstacles: Black blocks move down the screen continuously, and white holes appear randomly within the black blocks.
Game Over: The game ends when the character fails to navigate through a hole and touches the top of the screen.
Score: The score is determined by how many holes the character successfully passes through.
Technologies Used:
HTML: Provides the structure of the game.
CSS: Styles the game layout and elements.
JavaScript: Implements game logic, character movement, obstacle generation, collision detection, and score calculation.
How to Play:
Use the left and right arrow keys to move the red character.
Navigate the character through the white holes in the descending black blocks.
Avoid touching the top of the screen or failing to pass through a hole.
The game ends when the character cannot move further upward, and your score is displayed.

Future Improvements:
Implement levels with increasing difficulty.
Add sound effects and background music.
Integrate touch support for mobile devices.
