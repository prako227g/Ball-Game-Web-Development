# Ball-Game-Web-Development
This project is a simple game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game involves navigating a small red character (represented by a red circle) at the bottom of the screen using the left and right arrow keys. The objective is to avoid black blocks and navigate through white holes that appear randomly at the top of the screen
